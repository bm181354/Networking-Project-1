Project Description:Overview
In this assignment, you will be putting together knowledge of writing multi-threaded programs (server and client), broadcast and unicast communication, and application-layer protocols. By the end of this assignment, you will have created a chat room consisting of one server and multiple clients. The clients all connect to the server who is then the means through which the clients are able to send messages to each other. The clients can either send messages to everyone else that is in the chat room (broadcasting) or they can send private messages to their individual friends (unicasting). We have split this entire assignment into four parts so as to walk you through how to create this infrastructure. Only CS 655 students are required to complete the last part (Part IV).We strongly recommend that you use Java, however you can use the programming language of your choice (C, C++, Python). Skeleton Java code is provided at http://www.cs.bu.edu/fac/matta/Teaching/cs455/F16/Chat-handout

Part I: Writing an Echo Client-Server Application
Part II: Implementing a Broadcast Chat Room Using Multi-threading
Part III: Adding Unicast Capability to the Chat Room

Detail included in parts.
